1. First Assertion - globalThis as unknown

globalThis is a global object that represents the global scope, 
which exists in both browsers and Node.js environments. 
In TypeScript, globalThis has a default type definition that doesn’t 
include a prisma property. By default, TypeScript would not allow you to add properties 
to globalThis without modifying its type declaration.
To temporarily bypass the strict type-checking, 
the code first casts globalThis to unknown. 
The unknown type is TypeScript’s safe counterpart to any. 
By casting it to unknown, 
TypeScript stops caring about the current type structure 
of globalThis.

2. Second Assertion - as {prisma: PrismaClientSingleton | undefined}

After casting globalThis to unknown, the second type assertion casts it to a custom object structure that includes a prisma property.
In this case, we’re asserting that globalThis will have a property prisma, 
which is of type PrismaClientSingleton | undefined. 
This means the property prisma will either hold an instance 
of the Prisma client or be undefined (when no Prisma client has been initialized yet).
